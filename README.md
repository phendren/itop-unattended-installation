# itop-unattended-installation

This is a github repo for the unattended installation script found within the iTop hub documentation here:
 [itophub.io/wiki/](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?do=export_code&amp;id=2_5_0%3Aadvancedtopics%3Aautomatic_install&amp;codeblock=1)

 I have added this as a convenience since iTop is now available on github.


Credit for this script goes to the developers of iTop combodo.com.
